# Gold Rush!

##Background
This is a version of the Atari 400/800 game Gold Rush! which appeared in Compute! magazine in the 1980s. I did it mainly to learn Pygame, and it is not fully faithful to the original, but you can get the general idea.

This is what it looked like in the 1980s on an Atari computer:

This is my version for Pygame:

##Gameplay
Use the arrow keys to move the miner around. The jerky movement is intentional; it is an attempt to recreate the movement of the original.

To use a charge, hold down an arrow key next to a blocked area and press the space key. After the explosion the area will be clear, but beware: some parts of the mine will cave in after each explosion.

To exit the game, press the Escape key.
