# Gold Rush!

##Background
This is a version of the Atari 400/800 game Gold Rush! which appeared in Compute! magazine in the 1980s. I did it mainly to learn Pygame, and it is not fully faithful to the original, but you can get the general idea.

This is what it looked like in the 1980s on an Atari computer:
